1. In order to reproduce, or replicate, the twitter data in our project, you must obtain permission (i.e. Keys and Access tokens) to access the Twitter API and use the related data collection functions from the twitteR and rtweet packages.  Save tokens to home directory.

2. You must also set up an automated task on your computer to run the twitter.R Rscript every night at 3 am.  Cron was the utility we used for this project.

3. After the data collection is complete, you can manually run the remaining code for data analysis and visualizations.
